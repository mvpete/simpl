## Your Contribution Task: Enhance the Lessons

Now it's time for your final contribution! Choose one (or more) of these tasks:

### Option 1: Create a New Example Program

**Task:** Create a sophisticated SIMPL program in the `examples/` directory.

**Requirements:**
1. Use at least 5 different SIMPL features
2. Include comments explaining how it works
3. Add a header comment describing what it does
4. Test it thoroughly
5. Make it useful or educational

**Ideas:**
- **Quiz Game:** Multiple choice with score tracking
- **Text Adventure:** Room navigation with items
- **Calculator:** Expression parser and evaluator
- **Database:** Simple record management system
- **Simulation:** Weather, traffic, or ecosystem
- **AI:** Simple chatbot or decision tree

**Example structure:**
```simpl
###
### Filename: my_program.sl
### Author: Your Name
### Description: A cool SIMPL program that does something awesome
###

@import io
@import array

# Your amazing code here
```

### Option 2: Improve a Lesson

**Task:** Enhance one of the lessons (L0-L10) with better explanations or examples.

**What to improve:**
1. Fix any errors you found
2. Add clarifying examples
3. Expand confusing sections
4. Add helpful diagrams (ASCII art is fine!)
5. Include troubleshooting tips
6. Add bonus exercises

**Example addition to a lesson:**
```markdown
### Common Mistakes

**Mistake 1: Forgetting to import libraries**
```simpl
# Wrong - will fail
println("hello");

# Correct
@import io
println("hello");
```

**Why this happens:** The `println` function is in the `io` library, not built-in.
```

### Option 3: Write a Supplementary Guide

**Task:** Create a new guide document in the `lessons/` directory.

**Ideas:**
- **SIMPL Style Guide:** Best practices for writing SIMPL code
- **Common Patterns:** Reusable code patterns and idioms
- **Performance Tips:** How to write efficient SIMPL code
- **Debugging Guide:** How to debug SIMPL programs
- **Advanced Topics:** Deep dives into specific features
- **Project Ideas:** List of project ideas with difficulty ratings

**Template:**
```markdown
# SIMPL [Topic] Guide

## Introduction
Brief overview of what this guide covers.

## Section 1
Content here with examples.

## Section 2
More content with examples.

## Conclusion
Summary and next steps.
```

### Option 4: Add Tests

**Task:** Add more unit tests to the test suite.

**What to test:**
1. Edge cases in the tokenizer
2. Parser error handling
3. Engine boundary conditions
4. Library function behavior
5. Multi-method dispatch

**Example test:**
```cpp
TEST_METHOD(TestStringEscapeSequences)
{
    std::string text{ "\"hello\\nworld\"" };
    simpl::tokenizer t{ text };
    auto t1 = t.next();
    
    Assert::AreEqual(simpl::token_types::literal, t1.type);
    // Add assertions to verify escape sequences work
}
```

### Option 5: Create a Lesson Summary

**Task:** Create `lessons/LESSON_SUMMARY.md` that provides a quick reference.

**Include:**
- Brief description of each lesson
- Key concepts covered
- Estimated time to complete
- Prerequisites
- Difficulty level
- Links to related resources

**Example:**
```markdown

## Contribution Guidelines

### Code Style

**SIMPL Code:**
```simpl
# Good: Clear names, comments, proper spacing
def calculate_average(numbers) {
    let sum = 0;
    let count = length(numbers);
    
    for(let i = 0; i < count; i = i + 1) {
        sum = sum + numbers[i];
    }
    
    return sum / count;
}

# Avoid: Unclear names, no comments, cramped
def ca(n){let s=0;let c=length(n);for(let i=0;i<c;i=i+1){s=s+n[i];}return s/c;}
```

**Lesson Writing:**
- Use clear, simple language
- Include code examples for every concept
- Provide both explanation and code
- Use proper markdown formatting
- Test all code examples

### What Makes a Good Contribution

✅ **Good:**
- Clear, well-documented code
- Helpful explanations
- Tested and working examples
- Fixes real problems
- Teaches something useful

❌ **Avoid:**
- Untested code
- Unclear explanations
- Duplicate content
- Breaking changes without discussion
- Complex examples without explanation

## Example Contributions

### Example 1: New SIMPL Program

**File:** `examples/fibonacci.sl`
```simpl
###
### Fibonacci Sequence Generator
### Demonstrates: Recursion, functions, arrays
### Author: Alice Developer
###

@import io
@import array

# Recursive fibonacci
def fib_recursive(n) {
    if(n <= 1) {
        return n;
    }
    return fib_recursive(n - 1) + fib_recursive(n - 2);
}

# Iterative fibonacci (more efficient)
def fib_iterative(n) {
    if(n <= 1) {
        return n;
    }
    
    let a = 0;
    let b = 1;
    
    for(let i = 2; i <= n; i = i + 1) {
        let temp = a + b;
        a = b;
        b = temp;
    }
    
    return b;
}

# Generate fibonacci sequence
def fib_sequence(count) {
    let sequence = new [];
    
    for(let i = 0; i < count; i = i + 1) {
        push(sequence, fib_iterative(i));
    }
    
    return sequence;
}

# Demo
println("=== Fibonacci Numbers ===");
println("First 10 Fibonacci numbers:");

let fibs = fib_sequence(10);
println(fibs);

println("");
println("20th Fibonacci number: " + fib_iterative(20));
```

### Example 2: Lesson Improvement

**Addition to L7 (Arrays):**
```markdown
## Common Array Patterns

### Pattern: Map (Transform Each Element)

```simpl
@import io
@import array

def square(x) {
    return x * x;
}

def map(arr, func) {
    let result = new [];
    let count = length(arr);
    
    for(let i = 0; i < count; i = i + 1) {
        push(result, func(arr[i]));
    }
    
    return result;
}

let numbers = new [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let squares = map(numbers, &square);
println(squares);  # [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
```

This pattern applies a function to each element and returns a new array.
```

### Example 3: New Guide

**File:** `lessons/DEBUGGING_GUIDE.md`
```markdown
# Debugging SIMPL Programs

## Common Errors and Solutions

### Error: "Undefined variable"

**Problem:** Using a variable before declaring it.

**Solution:**
```simpl
# Wrong
println(x);
let x = 10;

# Correct
let x = 10;
println(x);
```

### Error: "Function not found"

**Problem:** Missing `@import` directive.

**Solution:**
```simpl
# Wrong
println("hello");

# Correct
@import io
println("hello");
```

## Debugging Techniques

### 1. Print Debugging

Add `println` statements to see variable values:

```simpl
let x = calculate_something();
println("Debug: x = " + x);  # Check the value
```

### 2. Simplify

Comment out code to isolate problems:

```simpl
# Complex code
# let result = complex_function(a, b, c);

# Simplified version for testing
let result = 42;
```

### 3. Check Types

Verify variable types match expectations:

```simpl
def process(value is number) {
    # Only accepts numbers
}
```
```
