# Lesson 2 - Anatomy { Parser }

## Intro
At this point we've converted the source code into a stream of tokens. The next part is to add some context to the stream,
this is done in the parser. The parsers responsibility is to iterate the stream of tokens looking for specific sequences of 
tokens that mean something. In SIMPL, each meaningful collection of tokens is called a `statement`. A statement is holds enough
information to be acted on by a component outside of the parser. In our case, this is our execution engine, but could equally be
some type of optimizer or a different backend.

Unlike tokenizing, parsing means that we need to add meaning to what the statements are representing. A statement in SIMPL is
made up of a collection of statements, or expressions.

*Note* I didn't write a formal grammar for this language. I kind of just made things up as I went.

Take for instance the following let statement

`let foo = new ["hello", "world"]`

A let statement (variable declaration) consists of an identifier and an expression to assign to the identifier. The expression 
is something that can be evaluated itself. In this case the expression is a `new array` expression, which houses two value 
expressions, hello and world.

The assignment statement

`foo[0] = "goodbye";`

Consists of an identifer expression and the value expression "goodbye";
